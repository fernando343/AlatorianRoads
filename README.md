# Simulation of a drunk walking

Course exercise "Computational Statistics with python" by Platzi.

### How to use
* Create a Virtual Environment: `python -m venv .env`
* We activate the environment:`.\Env\Scripts\activate`
* Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* To run run in a terminal: `python random_path.py`

In this program it serves us as a simulator as a drunk would walk in a certain number of steps
here we demonstrate the problem of **alatorian roads**

We can see a graph that represents the random paths of the drunk guy
